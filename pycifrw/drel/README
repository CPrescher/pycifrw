This is part of the PyCIFRW Python package for parsing and transforming dREL functions. dREL
is a language for specification of relationships among items in a
relationally-specified data framework.

You should have PLY (Python Lex/Yacc) installed as a prerequisite.

There are two separate approaches used: the first creates an Abstract Syntax Tree from a dREL
code section, then processes that AST into python code.  The second (older) code simply
processes dREL directly into Python.
