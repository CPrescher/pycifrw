Release Notes for PyCIFRW-4.1  
=============================

Version 4.1 is the first stable release in the next
major version of PyCIFRW.  It includes support for CIF 2.0 (including
unicode), dREL and DDLm
for the first time, with expanded documentation.  A number of major simplifications have gone on
under the hood leading to slightly faster CIF file input and much
simpler construction of loops.

Templates have been added for finer control over the 
layout of output CIF files. 

Incompatible changes (since 3.0 series)
=======================================

* Function "validate" has been renamed to Validate for consistency
* Nested loops (only allowed in STAR files) are no longer supported
* Merging of datablocks in 'overlay' mode has been removed. This is
  relevant only for dictionary merging.

Deprecated methods
==================

* AddCifItem.  This convoluted and mind-bending way of adding a whole loop all at once in a single tuple
has been deprecated.  Just assign dataname values using the usual square brackets and then call
CreateLoop with the datanames that belong in a single loop.
